1. Past Experience validation

5. Display results of server-validation.
6. More thorough validation on client side
7. Nationality - use dropdown maybe?
8. Selects - don't have default as Yes?
9. Required fields?
10. Use localstorage for storing values of the form
11. Workout the submit-button accessiblity. Something awkward.
